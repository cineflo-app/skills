description: "Read, explain and update a film's budget and cost report in CineFlo. Use this whenever the user asks what they've spent, what's over or under, what's committed, what's left, for hot costs, a cost report or a variance, or wants to add budget lines, purchase orders or actual costs, even if they only ask 'are we on budget'."

# Review the budget

Read the cost report like a line producer: where the money is, where it's
going over, and what's still coming.

## Before you start

Find the project with `list_projects`. If only one fits what the user said,
use it without asking; if several could, ask which, since writing to the
wrong production is hard to notice later. If a tool says a tab isn't shared
or is view-only, tell the user it's set in CineFlo under Settings → Privacy &
Data → Connected Apps, and carry on with what you can do.
If no CineFlo tools are available at all, CineFlo isn't connected yet:
follow the connect-cineflo skill.

The steps below are good production practice, not rules to hold to: when
the user asks for something different, do it their way.

## 1. Read the cost report

`list_projects`, then `get_budget`. Amounts are integer cents in the budget's
currency: divide by 100 and show the currency (150000 is 1,500.00 USD).

The report has accounts in four categories (above the line, below the line,
post, other), line items with their budgeted totals, purchase orders (POs)
and actuals, and rollups per line, account, category and grand total.

- **Committed** is POs that are submitted or approved; draft POs count
  nowhere; invoiced and paid POs are costs.
- **Actual** is money spent (invoiced and paid POs, and actuals).
- **Estimate to complete** (ETC) is what's still expected on a line;
  **estimate at completion** is actual plus ETC. Compare that with the budget
  for the variance.
- `totalInCents` excludes payroll fringe; `fringeInCents` shows it
  separately.
- "Unassigned" is money booked to an account but none of its lines.

## 2. Explain it

Lead with the answer to what the user asked. For a general review:

- The grand total against budget, and the variance.
- Lines over budget, largest first, with the amount and the reason if the PO
  or actual description gives one.
- Open commitments that will land soon.
- Money booked to an account but no line, which usually needs assigning.

Keep it to the lines that matter; offer the full list. For example:

```
You're $1,550 over on $48,200 so far (3.2%), almost all in two lines:
- 3300 Camera package: $5,200 actual vs $3,800 budgeted (+$1,400). The invoice notes a second body.
- 4100 Rain towers: $2,450 vs $1,800 (+$650), deposit plus overtime.
Committed but not yet spent: $4,400 (G&E truck PO, approved).
$385 is booked to Props (5200) without a line; worth assigning.
```

## 3. Change it only when asked

Use `save_budget` to add or change accounts, line items, POs and actuals, up to
100 of each per call. Amounts go in as cents; `totalInCents` is quantity × rate.
A locked budget stays editable, and edits move the revised figures, never the
original baseline. Confirm figures with the user before writing them, and
report what changed.

## Notes

- If Budget is shared view-only, answer questions and say that changes need
  edit access (CineFlo, Settings → Privacy & Data → Connected Apps).
- This records costs; it doesn't place orders or move money.
