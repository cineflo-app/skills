description: "Plan coverage and build shot lists in CineFlo. Use this whenever the user wants shots, coverage, setups, angles or a shot list for a scene, a sequence or the whole film, asks how to shoot or cover a scene, or wants to add, rework or extend shots, even if they don't say 'shot list' or name CineFlo. Asks about coverage style and camera package first when they're unknown."

# Build a shot list

Plan coverage the way the director and DP would, using the project's own
coverage style and camera package, then save the shots to CineFlo.

## Before you start

Find the project with `list_projects`. If only one fits what the user said,
use it without asking; if several could, ask which, since writing to the
wrong production is hard to notice later. If a tool says a tab isn't shared
or is view-only, tell the user it's set in CineFlo under Settings → Privacy &
Data → Connected Apps, and carry on with what you can do.

The steps below are good production practice, not rules to hold to: when
the user asks for something different, do it their way.

## 1. Find the project and the scene

- `list_projects`, then `get_scene` with the `sceneNumber` the user gave
  (or `sceneId`). The scene carries its heading, INT/EXT, time of day, story
  day, page length in eighths, cast numbers, synopsis and any existing shots.
- If the scene already has shots, build on them: don't recreate a shot that
  exists. Ask whether to add to them or replace them before deleting anything.

## 2. Know how the project will be shot

Call `get_shot_planning`.

- If `asked` is false, or coverage style or cameras are in `unanswered`,
  settle them before designing shots. Call `save_shot_planning` with only the
  `projectId`: where the app can show forms, the user gets a short form and the
  answers are saved. If nothing comes back filled in, ask in chat instead, in
  one message: coverage style (classic, long takes, handheld / vérité,
  efficient, stylized), how many cameras, and the camera bodies and lenses if
  known. Save what they tell you with `save_shot_planning`.
- If the user says they don't know yet or to just go ahead, use classic
  coverage on one camera and say so.
- Ask once per project. When `asked` is true, use what's saved without asking
  again, and mention it in one line ("Planning for 2 cameras, Alexa 35 on
  Signature Primes, classic coverage").

## 3. Read the scene

Call `get_scene_text` for the scene when Script pages are on for the project.
If they're off, work from the synopsis and heading, and tell the user the plan
is from the synopsis only. For a sequence, read up to 40 scenes in one call
with `sceneNumbers`.

Note who speaks, who reacts, entrances and exits, the key props and actions,
and the beats that turn the scene.

## 4. Design the coverage

Match the coverage style:

- **classic**: an establishing or master shot, mediums, a single (or over the
  shoulder) for each speaking character, reverses, and inserts for key props
  and actions.
- **long_takes**: few setups; describe the blocking and the move in each
  shot, and add cutaways only where the scene needs a way out.
- **handheld**: coverage from inside the scene, reactive and loose; fewer
  locked-off inserts.
- **efficient**: the fewest setups that tell the scene; combine angles, and
  with two cameras cross-cover (A and B on opposite sides of the eyeline) to
  save turnarounds.
- **stylized**: designed frames and motivated moves; say what each frame is
  for.

Then:

- Use the app's vocabulary for size, angle, shot type, movement and rig
  (the values listed in `save_shots`), for example size `W`, `MS`, `MCU`,
  `CU`, `MCU (OTS)`; movement `Static`, `Dolly`, `Tracking`; rig `Sticks`,
  `Dolly`, `Steadicam`, `Handheld`.
- Pick focal lengths the lens package actually has. With a zoom, give the
  focal length you'd set.
- With more than one camera, put the second camera's frame in the same shot
  on `cameraSlot` `B` rather than as a separate shot.
- Put the cast numbers in `cast` (1 is usually the lead); a new shot defaults
  to the scene's cast.
- Order shots in the order you'd shoot them within a lighting setup, and give
  a rough `estimatedMinutes` for each.
- Leave `shotNumber` empty: CineFlo numbers new shots in the user's own style
  (letters or numbers, and whether I and O are skipped).

## 5. Confirm, then save

Show the plan as a short table (shot, size, angle or movement, lens,
description) with one line on the approach. Save when the user agrees, or
straight away if they asked you to create the shots.

For example (the shape to aim for, not content to reuse):

```
Scene 12 · INT. DINER - NIGHT · 1 3/8 pages · classic coverage, 2 cameras (Alexa 35, Signature Primes)

| Shot | Size       | Angle / move      | Lens | Covers                                          |
|------|------------|-------------------|------|-------------------------------------------------|
| A    | W          | Eye level, sticks | 24mm | Master: Maya enters, crosses to Dev's booth     |
| B    | MCU (OTS)  | Dolly in slowly   | 50mm | Dev over Maya's shoulder through "You knew her?"; B cam: Maya's reverse on 75mm |
| C    | CU         | Static            | 85mm | Maya reading the letter                         |
| D    | Insert     | Overhead          | 100mm macro | The letter's last line                   |
```

Numbers are left out so CineFlo assigns them in the user's style.

Save with one `save_shots` call (up to 100 shots). Report how many shots were
added and their numbers, then call `get_shots` with the `sceneId` so the user
sees the shot list.

## Notes

- `save_shots` can't move a shot to another scene: create it in the new scene
  and delete the old one with `delete_shot`.
- To renumber a scene after reordering, use `renumber_shots`; custom names such
  as PU1 are kept.
- If a tool says the Scenes & Shots tab isn't shared or is view-only, tell the
  user where to change it (CineFlo, Settings → Privacy & Data → Connected
  Apps) and offer the plan as text meanwhile.
