description: "Update a CineFlo project after a new script draft or revised pages. Use this whenever the user mentions a new draft, a rewrite, revised or coloured pages (blue, pink, yellow), asks what changed in the script, or wants the breakdown, shot lists or schedule brought in line with the latest draft, even if they only say 'the writer sent new pages'."

# Update the project for a script revision

A new draft ripples through everything built from the old one. Find what
changed, show what it touches, and update what the user agrees to.

## Before you start

Find the project with `list_projects`. If only one fits what the user said,
use it without asking; if several could, ask which, since writing to the
wrong production is hard to notice later. If a tool says a tab isn't shared
or is view-only, tell the user it's set in CineFlo under Settings → Privacy &
Data → Connected Apps, and carry on with what you can do.
If no CineFlo tools are available at all, CineFlo isn't connected yet:
follow the connect-cineflo skill.

The steps below are good production practice, not rules to hold to: when
the user asks for something different, do it their way.

## 1. Get the new draft in

If the user hasn't imported it yet, give them the link from
`start_script_import`: the screenplay is uploaded in CineFlo, and a new import
is a revision that keeps tagged elements and the previous draft.

## 2. See what changed

`get_script_info` gives the revision (colour and cycle, such as "2nd Blue"),
its date, and each scene's status against the previous draft: unchanged,
changed, new or omitted. Work only on the scenes that aren't unchanged.

For each changed or new scene, read the new text with `get_scene_text` (up to
40 scenes per call with `sceneNumbers`). You can't see the old text, so judge
the change from the new text against the current breakdown and shots.

## 3. Work out the impact

For each scene that changed, check:

- **Breakdown** (`get_breakdown` for the scene): elements the new text no
  longer mentions, and new ones it needs (a new character, prop, vehicle or
  effect).
- **Shots** (`get_scene`): shots whose description no longer matches the
  action, speakers who now need coverage, and shots for moments that were cut.
- **Schedule** (`get_schedule`): the scene's shoot day, whether its page
  length changed, and cast added or dropped for that day.

For omitted scenes: whether they still have shots, and whether they're
scheduled. An omitted scene keeps its number; don't reuse it.

## 4. Report, then update

Report per scene in a compact list: what changed and what it affects. Put
the things that cost time or money first: new cast, new locations, stunts or
effects, and schedule moves. For example:

```
Blue revision (Oct 2): 4 changed, 1 new, 1 omitted
- Sc 14 changed: Ruth now speaks → cast #5 needed on Day 1; add her single
- Sc 22A new: EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT → new location, not scheduled
- Sc 30 omitted: 6 shots, scheduled Day 7 → unschedule?
- Sc 8, 11, 19 changed: dialogue only; breakdown and shots still fit
```

Then offer the updates:

- Breakdown: `save_breakdown` for new elements. Remove tags that no longer
  apply with `delete_breakdown_tag` only after the user agrees.
- Shots: propose revised shots and save with `save_shots`. Ask before
  deleting a shot, or mark it `skipped`: shots can carry notes, takes and
  reference images the user wants to keep.
- Schedule: unschedule omitted scenes with `update_stripboard`
  (`unschedule_scene`) when the user agrees, and flag days that are now too
  long or too short.

## Notes

- Don't renumber existing scenes in a revision: call sheets and shot lists
  already use those numbers. New scenes take the number printed in the
  script, or the next free one, and a number in use is never reused.
- If Script pages are off for the project, you can still report statuses from
  `get_script_info` but not read the text; say so.
