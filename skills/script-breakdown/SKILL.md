description: "Break down a screenplay into production elements in CineFlo: cast, extras, props, set dressing, wardrobe, makeup, vehicles, animals, stunts, effects and the rest. Use this whenever the user asks to break down, tag or mark up the script or some scenes, asks what a scene needs, or wants the elements list a schedule, budget or call sheet will depend on, even without the word 'breakdown'."

# Break down the script

Tag every element a scene needs, the way a first AD or script supervisor
marks up a script, and save it to the project's breakdown.

## Before you start

Find the project with `list_projects`. If only one fits what the user said,
use it without asking; if several could, ask which, since writing to the
wrong production is hard to notice later. If a tool says a tab isn't shared
or is view-only, tell the user it's set in CineFlo under Settings → Privacy &
Data → Connected Apps, and carry on with what you can do.
If no CineFlo tools are available at all, CineFlo isn't connected yet:
follow the connect-cineflo skill.

The steps below are good production practice, not rules to hold to: when
the user asks for something different, do it their way.

## 1. Check what's there

- `list_projects`, then `get_script_info` to see the current draft and, after
  a revision, which scenes are new or changed. On a revised script, break
  down only the new and changed scenes unless the user asks for all of them.
- `get_breakdown` for the scenes you'll work on, so you reuse existing
  elements and don't tag the same thing twice.
- If there's no script yet, give the user the importer link from
  `start_script_import`: the screenplay is uploaded in CineFlo, not here.

## 2. Read the scenes

`get_scene_text` returns up to 40 scenes per call (`sceneNumbers`). Work in
batches: read a batch, save its breakdown, then move on. Script pages must be
switched on for the project; if they're off, say so and stop.

## 3. Decide each element's category

Use the breakdown categories exactly as `save_breakdown` lists them. The
common calls:

- **cast**: speaking or named characters, as scripted in capitals ("SARAH").
  Tagging a cast element also adds the character to the cast list and the
  scene's cast.
- **extrasAtmosphere** (background) vs **extrasSilent** (featured, no lines);
  give `quantity` when the script implies a number.
- **props**: anything a character handles. **setDressing**: what's in the set
  that nobody handles. **greenery**: plants and landscaping.
- **wardrobe** and **makeup**: tie them to a character with
  `linkedCastNumber` when they belong to one (blood on MAYA's scrubs).
- **vehicles**, **animals** (plus **animalWrangler**), **stunts**.
- **sfx** for practical on-set effects such as rain or smoke;
  **mechanicalEffects** for rigged mechanisms; **vfx** for anything added in
  post.
- **sound** and **music** for playback or anything heard that must be on set;
  **specialEquipment** and **camera** for gear the scene demands (a crane, an
  underwater housing).

When a scene is ambiguous, pick the most useful category and add a scene
note on the tag rather than asking.

## 4. Save

- Use one `save_breakdown` call per batch, with up to 100 elements. Give each
  element's `tags` the scenes it appears in (`sceneNumber`) and a short
  `phrase` from the script so the tag anchors to the words that call for it.
- An element with the same name in the same category is reused, not
  duplicated, and a repeated tag is skipped, so re-running a scene is safe.
- Per-scene notes go on the tag (`notes`), not on the element.

## 5. Report

Summarize per scene: how many elements were tagged, by category, and anything
that needs a decision (an unclear character, a stunt that needs a
coordinator, a vehicle that needs a picture car). Use `update_breakdown_tags`
to fix notes or move a tag to another scene afterwards.
